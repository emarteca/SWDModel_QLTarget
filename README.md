# SWDModel_QLTarget

Old version of SWDModel with some design flaws on purpose, as an exercise for QL queries for a course assignment.


## SWDModel

This is a framework for running fruit fly population simulations. 
The populations are represented as a system of coupled linear differential equations.

Simulations represent the population levels of various stages of fruit fly development, and take as input a configuration file and a list of daily temperatures.

## This code

This is an old deprecated version of the project, not designed for use. 
The simulator is now written in C++, for which the source code can be found at https://github.com/emarteca/dsPopSim
